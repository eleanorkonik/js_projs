## Reflections

* I read [Polygamy, Human Sacrifices, and Steel â€“ Why the Aztecs Were Awesome](https://dormin.org/2020/06/25/polygamy-human-sacrifices-and-steel-why-the-aztecs-were-awesome/amp/) by Dormin again and continue to really like the structure of it. Dormin is the one who recommended Slate Star Codex to me and this structure of book review, so at some point I really want to write a book review of one of my academic textbooks in this format.
