## Reflections
* This [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/lrmtbm/has_there_been_a_group_of_people_who_have_adapted) had a lot of really interesting information about sleep in different cultures that I should cross reference against a previous daily note about sleep in two African cultures to synthesize a new note that I can use as a basis for [[Culture Creation from the Bed Up]], along the lines of a world building article about the nature of sleep in different cultures as an overlooked way to create a unique culture. 
* This [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13r37l/many_fantasyhistorical_computer_games_and_rpgs) is an absolutely fantastic discussion of how historic palaces led to the mythology surrounding the labyrinth and video game style dungeons. 
* This [article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-unearth-golden-tongued-mummy-egypt-180976905/) is a neat idea for world building, it talks about how in [[Egypt]], mummies had their tongues replaced with golden tongues so that the individual who was buried would have a tongue in the afterlife and be able to talk. It's a similar idea to [[Greek]] paying the ferryman with a coin under the tongue. 

## Accomplishments
* Made substantial progress on [[2021-W08]] prompt, which seems destined to become a short story instead of flash fiction.
