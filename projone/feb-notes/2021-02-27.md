## Goals

## Reflections
- Interesting [history of the invention of the bow](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lt7e1h/how_did_bows_and_arrows_evolve_separately_so_many/) with some useful insights about why it's difficult to determine whether the bow and arrow were invented once (like the [[2020.12.07 Waterwheels|wheel]]) or multiple times (like agriculture) in different times and places. It also covers competing technology like the blow pipe and sling. One problem is that [[2020.08.31 Arrows|arrows]] can be made of bone or wood and don't necessarily remain in the archaeological record.
