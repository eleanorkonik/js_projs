## Reflections
* I loved [this comment](https://jetreidliterary.blogspot.com/2014/04/query-question-reasons-for-rejection.html?showComment=1398525522486#c1606949781138143165) from an old post by Janet Reid (QueryShark). When the odds are against you, you can't take it personally when you get rejected; sometimes, acceptance come down to sheer blind luck and entirely arbitrary preferences. 

## Accomplishments

* Took the first baby steps into learning [[Election Javascript]]
* Went through bookmarks and pulled down files into permanent files: 
	* [[How To Choose an Agent]]
	* [[â‡¶ Resources for Self Pub]]
	* [[POE Guides]]
