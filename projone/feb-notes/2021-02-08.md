## Reflections

* Used [this](https://www.oneindia.com/2008/01/17/excavations-karnak-temple-egypt-change-history-landscape-1200553260.html) article as a reference for [[04 Marna]] to determine that sandstone was used by the ancients to build embankments. I wasn't able to find any easily accessible information about what ancient docks were made out of. 

## Accomplishments

* Added a little bit to [[04 Marna]].
