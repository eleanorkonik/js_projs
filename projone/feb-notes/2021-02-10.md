## Planned Edits

Talk about how the people who built the temple of the architect would definitely have built the underground tunnels in marna, because in marna there is actually enough meaningful ground underneath of the city for that to be viable, when she arrives in the city have the description talk about how much narrow of the river is here, really riff off here for the Texas river and how I barely thought it counted his River but it was technically navigable.  
  
She needs to accept the call at the end of chapter 5 so it makes sense for the struggle to be to her get to the governor, and then the next scene be her accepting the call with the governor who basically gets her on board with project needing to overhaul the 100 West country in order to make sure that everybody stays loyal to Valentia, she goes out into the wilds not as a rebel but as somebody who is trying desperately to save the country, she is planning not to undermine Lupicin but she is definitely having come out of that conversation with the bold statement that she is going to do what she can in order to preserve the Union. so to that and she should definitely actually meet with the governor after she meets with her mentor. Double check with the structure says for what that scene at that point in the story is supposed to be, I don't remember what comes after meeting the mentor and crossing the threshold, but probably leaving Marna would count as crossing the threshold?. you're going to have to be some stuff with how short the chapters are compared to the word count of a proper novel, but I might be able to flush that out with other points of view, we'll see once it's done, because I can probably also flush out the actual scenes with more description and minor conflicts.  
  
This way, the crowd confrontation happens after her conference conversation with the governor, so she goes from talking to the governor about how she's going to preserve the union to being pelted by terrible, racist people, and essentially walks out into the highway with her chin held high and determined to do the right thing, even though these people are assholes, it gives her the opportunity to give arousing speech on her way out. Crossing the threshold with a bang, as it were.

## Accomplishments
