## Reflections

* I read a bunch of chapters of [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret]] at the YMCA and then while Max played with his books. My brain is basically exploding from all of it but the most important thing I read was definitely the "Commercial Revolution" being more of a game-changer than the dissemination of iron tools. 
* I enjoyed this [[rAskHistorians]] thread about [why ancient portraits didn't really bother with realism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lccnqi/why_are_the_12_disciples_typically_depicted_as/) -- 

> Whilst Christ was represented with the Hellenistic youth archetype, the apostles were represented as Greek philosophers. Remember, whilst Christ was divine, his apostles were the teachers who spread Christian theology. Rather than a young, beardless and godly figure, the apostles were represented as the Hellenistic philosopher, older and bearded.
