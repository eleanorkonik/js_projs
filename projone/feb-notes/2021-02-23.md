## Reflections
* I enjoyed this [book recommendation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kcece4/askhistorians_2020_holiday_book_recommendation/) from [[rAskHistorians]]. I'm particularly interested in:
	* _The Pillow Book_ by Sei Sh≈çnagon
	* _After the Ice: A Global Human History 20,000-5000 BC_ by Steven Mithen

## Accomplishments
* pushed [[The Difficultues of Teaching Notetaking]] live. 
* finished _Calculated Risk_ by Seanan McGuire.
