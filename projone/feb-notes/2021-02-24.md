## Reflections

* I enjoyed [this long-form book review about a 1980s era book about class in America](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-fussell-on-class?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MDc2ODE1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozMjg2MzQ2NSwiXyI6InpOWllYIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE0MjAxNjI0LCJleHAiOjE2MTQyMDUyMjQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi04OTEyMCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.Bo5OUyUkfpM7e_eObhZiJbvEQn6EGol82mqqM5bCAgs). I'm not sure I learned anything particularly insightful from it, but it was definitely eerie.
