## Reflections
* Read some absolutely great stuff in Chapter 02 of [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret]] that will be useful for [[All the Things that Trees Can Be]] (mostly about domesticating different kinds of palms) and then coincidentally this Atlas Obscura [article about the difficulties of commercializing palm wine](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/palm-wine-in-united-states) crossed my RSS feed. 

<blockquote class=paraphrase> Palm wine is a naturally occurring alcohol, produced as ambient yeast and bacteria, encouraged by hot and moist tropical air, feast on the sugars in palm sap. It spontaneously forms whenever there is damage to the palm tree. Because of this rapid fermentation, palm wine is difficult to stabilize, and turns to vinegar within a few days of tapping.</blockquote>

* I found this absolutely amazing article about [[Ancient Mesopotamian Gardens]] that I need to do a deep dive on later but more importantly I need to finish [[02 Valentia]] so it needs to wait. But it's an absolutely amazing overview of Mesopotamian palace gardens! 

## Accomplishments
* Finalized the first scene of [[02 Valentia]]. 
* Took some nice notes on [[tamarisk]] trees.
