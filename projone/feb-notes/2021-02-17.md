## Reflections

* Apparently [[2020.11.09 Pigs|pigs]] are pretty good at video games, according to [a study](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pigs-play-video-games_n_6026b303c5b6741597e1a3ac) shared in the Huffington Post. Notably, the pigs did better than a dog. 
* More [citibank news](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back) and the whole situation is even crazier than I thought it was.  I'm not entirely sure I understand it well enough to do it justice, but I think the tldr here is that Citibank and Revlon did some kind of loan restructuring that their software wasn't designed for, and the poor guy in charge of clicking the buttons on the computer at Citibank had to deal with this a really unintuitive, antiquated ui, and  accidentally sent like 900 million dollars to some hedge funds who didn't realize it was "in error" so a judge says they get to keep the money.
* I read chapters 12-17 of [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]] and finally learned why chariots were such a big deal. Plus:
	* [[impact of increasing maximum herd size in a region]]
* read this [tweetstorm from Old European Culture](https://twitter.com/serbiaireland/status/1362137601583575042) about Baden cultures (which are mentioned in [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]]) and archaeologists talking about how they "sacrificed" their animals in burials and the conclusions really reminded me of what I wanted to say about [[Suttee Sacral kingship and Human Sacrifice|sacral kingship]], so I might need to expand on that some more.
