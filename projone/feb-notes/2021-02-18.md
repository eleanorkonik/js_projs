## Reflections

* This [[rAskHistorians]] response discusses [what a chantry is](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lm4pdp/what_happened_to_all_the_perpetual_mass/) and why they no longer exist. It never bothered me enough to look it up because I honestly assumed that Dragon Age had just invented them as an alternative to "Catholic Church" but it's kind of cool knowing that they based it on something real. 
* Read this article about [hypothermia](http://dankoboldt.com/hypothermia-in-fiction/) directed at fiction writers, but overall I'm not sure it told me anything I couldn't have found elsewhere on the internet. It might be useful for one of the "truth is stranger than fiction" [[Article & Blog Ideas]], though, since you can get hypothermia at 70F and most readers probably wouldn't buy that. 
* Interesting [[rAskHistorians]] [discussion about the border "marches" in the UK and Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lmio13/what_exactly_was_a_march_they_were_defensive/), which shines some interesting light on the Spellsong Cycle by LE Modessit and might be useful for [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]]. 
* Learned about https://the.rip for unrolling twitter threads into markdown. 

## Accomplishments

* Finished [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]].
* Learned some nifty javascript things and started a "learning in public" [github repo. ](https://github.com/eleanorkonik/js_projs)
