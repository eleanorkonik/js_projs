* I found [this article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-grass-beds-insect-repellent) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/labcys/how_did_ancient_humanshunter_gatherers_stop_bugs/). It's about how ancient humans in southern Africa (Border Cave, 200,000 years ago) kept away bugs at night: 

> Ash spread beneath bound bunches of grass may have been used to repel crawling, biting insects, which cannot easily move through fine powder.

* Found [this thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/annotation-symols/12273/6) on the obsidian forums about a (frustratingly unnamed) Russian guy who advocates identifying different types of information (which might have implications for ways to annotate). I like the idea of adapting this into a color code with sticky notes for annotating long texts. 

	-   “proteins”, a.k.a. **directly actionable info**. This is something you can start using immediately: a new lifehack or trick, a principle that you can include into your daily life, stuff like this.
	-   “carbs”, a.k.a. the ideas and concepts that you have to think about for a while (“to break down a bit”), and which motivate you and/or **make you wonder.** These could potentially deliver way more “energy” than a “protein” would: a piece of ancient stoic wisdom that you have “to chew on”, or a curious insight into human behavior, or a new concept that explains some things that didn’t quite make sense before.
	-   “fats”, a.k.a. the **flavor** bits that make a book “tastier”: stories, metaphors etc.
	-   “vitamins”, a.k.a the stuff that makes you **erudite**: curious cases, anecdotes, pithy quotes.
	-   “fiber”, a.k.a. **hard data**: numbers, figures, tables, facts, references to other books or people, statistics and so on. Books without fiber usually fall into “philosophical musings” category (or are fiction).
	-   the rest is “water”. Necessary, but not worth writing home about (or taking notes on). 


* Read some absolutely great stuff in Chapter 02 of [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret]] that will be useful for [[All the Things that Trees Can Be]] (mostly about domesticating different kinds of palms) and then coincidentally this Atlas Obscura [article about the difficulties of commercializing palm wine](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/palm-wine-in-united-states) crossed my RSS feed. 

<blockquote class=paraphrase> Palm wine is a naturally occurring alcohol, produced as ambient yeast and bacteria, encouraged by hot and moist tropical air, feast on the sugars in palm sap. It spontaneously forms whenever there is damage to the palm tree. Because of this rapid fermentation, palm wine is difficult to stabilize, and turns to vinegar within a few days of tapping.</blockquote>

* I found this absolutely amazing article about [[Ancient Mesopotamian Gardens]] that I need to do a deep dive on later but more importantly I need to finish [[02 Valentia]] so it needs to wait. But it's an absolutely amazing overview of Mesopotamian palace gardens! 

* Made some more progress on [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret]]


* I read a bunch of chapters of [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret]] at the YMCA and then while Max played with his books. My brain is basically exploding from all of it but the most important thing I read was definitely the "Commercial Revolution" being more of a game-changer than the dissemination of iron tools. 
* I enjoyed this [[rAskHistorians]] thread about [why ancient portraits didn't really bother with realism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lccnqi/why_are_the_12_disciples_typically_depicted_as/) -- 

> Whilst Christ was represented with the Hellenistic youth archetype, the apostles were represented as Greek philosophers. Remember, whilst Christ was divine, his apostles were the teachers who spread Christian theology. Rather than a young, beardless and godly figure, the apostles were represented as the Hellenistic philosopher, older and bearded.

* This [[rAskHistorians]] thread on the topic of [how much did Persia, Rome and China have to do with Axum](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ldwcqz/the_manichean_prophet_mani_regarded_axum_as_one/) might be useful cross-referencing with [[The Civilizations of Africa - Chapter 5#ch05p215 Politics and Trade in the Kingdom of Aksum]]. #FollowUp 

* Read this [neat article](https://web.nmsu.edu/~pscott/isgem71.htm) about how women were probably the first mathematicians. 


* Used [this](https://www.oneindia.com/2008/01/17/excavations-karnak-temple-egypt-change-history-landscape-1200553260.html) article as a reference for [[04 Marna]] to determine that sandstone was used by the ancients to build embankments. I wasn't able to find any easily accessible information about what ancient docks were made out of. 


* I enjoyed [this article about synthesis and notetaking](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/2) which outlines these four type of notes for the synthesis process, which I find significantly more insightful than just "take atomic notes" — ^451805

> * Question notes, which express an open research question,
> * Synthesis notes, which express a single, generalized idea, such as a claim,
> * Observation notes, which express a single, highly contextualized and specific observation that, together with other observation notes, can form the basis of a synthesis note, and
> * Context snippet notes, which help to ground and contextualize observation notes.


* I enjoyed [The Precision of Sensory Evidence](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-precision-of-sensory-evidence) via Scott Alexander at Astral Ten Codex. It presented the first "unified theory of depression" I've ever really come across, and has some really interesting explanations — with citations, from a licensed psychiatrist — of recent research into how depression commonly works, how "priors" can come to outweigh other lived experiences when experiencing depression — and why meditation and yoga and massage (and hugs!) help combat this. 
* This [thread about privacy and sex in different cultures throughout history](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4qkr04/what_was_sex_like_when_most_people_lived_in_1/), which involves a very polite disagreement (aka a bare-knuckle brawl by academic standards) between academics about how the Protestant Reformation impacted European ideals about sex and privacy, the importance of beds (and more importantly, bed *curtains*) as cultural heirlooms, and some interesting legal cases, particularly relating toward the evolution of Italian sexual mores from the Roman era to Florence with regards to sodomy norms at different ages. %% I used this for the [[2021.02.15 Beds]] newsletter %%


* The blogger at Old European culture has a really great [article](http://oldeuropeanculture.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-best-bits.html) about the culinary uses for entrails and organs, the animal slaughtering schedule/calendar in 1900s Serbia, and posits that the eating of entrails and especially chyme, which is basically gastric juices and partially digested food from the entrails of animals. He posits that neolithic humans eating chyme may have been related to the early invention of cheese and may even be related to the origins of lactose tolerance in humans. He discusses this more in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/serbiaireland/status/1360985437972684802). 
* Read a couple more pages of [[The Golden Thread by Kassia St Claire|The Golden Thread]] — I started the chapter about Viking sails, and it discusses [Ibn Fadlan](https://travellerantiqueland.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/tall-as-date-palms-arab-meets-viking/) and his interactions with the Vikings and particularly the funerary practice of ritually raping and murdering a chief's concubine (which was referenced by [Taher Safavi](https://twitter.com/bewarethejabb?lang=en) in upcoming book BERSERKER QUEEN). I definitely want to tie that in to the forthcoming article about [[Suttee Sacral kingship and Human Sacrifice]]. 
* Found this article about an [ancient shell horn](https://apnews.com/article/18000-year-old-shell-horn-still-works-58e6d61aa9773d2c672854325d884230) that can still play music, despite being over 18,000 years old. Added to [[Article & Blog Ideas]] for something about ancient instruments, cf. [[The Civilizations of Africa - Chapter 3]], which discusses side-blown horns made out of animal horns. 


* I read [Polygamy, Human Sacrifices, and Steel – Why the Aztecs Were Awesome](https://dormin.org/2020/06/25/polygamy-human-sacrifices-and-steel-why-the-aztecs-were-awesome/amp/) by Dormin again and continue to really like the structure of it. Dormin is the one who recommended Slate Star Codex to me and this structure of book review, so at some point I really want to write a book review of one of my academic textbooks in this format. 

* The [Citibank vs. Revlon case](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/citigroup-loses-fight-to-get-back-millions-in-mistaken-transfer) is pretty interesting (and high in schadenfreude). It boils down to a "no take backsies" kind of argument. Apparently it's an accepted part of the finance world that take-backsies is allowed and legal if the judge decides that all parties involved could reasonably be expected to view it as a mistake at the time the transaction occurred. But this only applies for *obvious* mistakes and the debate is basically over how much you can expect someone who receives money to be like "are you sure? are you SURE you want to do something that totally makes sense?"
* I read and processed a bunch from [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]]. My big takeaways were:
	* [[labels for different kinds of human settlements]] supertowns aren't the same things as cities. There were some interesting implications for [[Impacts of Increasing Population Density]] that I need to add to that roundup, too. 
	* [[Creature Creation from the Taming Of]] - there was a lot of information about the impacts of domestication, particularly of horses. 
	* [[Contextualizing Ancient Wars for Modern Eyes]] - lots of stuff that reminds me of [[2021-01-03]] and the information there about why the ancients raided. 


* Apparently [[2020.11.09 Pigs|pigs]] are pretty good at video games, according to [a study](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pigs-play-video-games_n_6026b303c5b6741597e1a3ac) shared in the Huffington Post. Notably, the pigs did better than a dog. 
* More [citibank news](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back) and the whole situation is even crazier than I thought it was.  I'm not entirely sure I understand it well enough to do it justice, but I think the tldr here is that Citibank and Revlon did some kind of loan restructuring that their software wasn't designed for, and the poor guy in charge of clicking the buttons on the computer at Citibank had to deal with this a really unintuitive, antiquated ui, and  accidentally sent like 900 million dollars to some hedge funds who didn't realize it was "in error" so a judge says they get to keep the money.
* I read chapters 12-17 of [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]] and finally learned why chariots were such a big deal. Plus:
	* [[impact of increasing maximum herd size in a region]]
* read this [tweetstorm from Old European Culture](https://twitter.com/serbiaireland/status/1362137601583575042) about Baden cultures (which are mentioned in [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]]) and archaeologists talking about how they "sacrificed" their animals in burials and the conclusions really reminded me of what I wanted to say about [[Suttee Sacral kingship and Human Sacrifice|sacral kingship]], so I might need to expand on that some more. 
 
* Really enjoyed this [post](https://sarahgailey.substack.com/p/the-unstable-present) from Arkady Martine about how the [[Incan|Inca]] and Byzantine Empires inspired her fiction. Could be useful for the [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] series.
* Did some reading about [Salish wool dogs](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/salish-woolly-dog), an extinct breed of dog that was bred and sheered for their wool by some indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Planning to use this in [[90 Articles/Seeds/Creature Creation for the Textiles Of]]
* [Whalebone](https://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Baleen) is really interesting from a history of fashion perspective, but it's not really a textile; use for [[Creature Creation for the Clothes]] as a blog post accompaniment to the [[Creature Creation for the Textiles Of]] piece, which would be a proper magazine article. 
* Learned about [wool pigs](https://www.dartagnan.com/mangalica-pig-heritage-pork.html) which are grown more for their lard than their "wool," so it's not clear whether or not their wool can be used for textiles, but it's still worth nothing for [[Creature Creation for the Textiles Of]]. 
* Did some digging into the history of how feathers were used as textiles, for example [this blanket made out of domestic turkey feathers](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/800-year-old-blanket-holds-clues-turkey-farming-american-southwest-180976438/). Domestic turkeys are interesting because you can pluck them painlessly while they're alive and use the feathers for lots of things like blankets. 

> The turkey is the only bird that allows feathers to be taken and it won’t bleed; It has a defensive mechanism to where if a predator grabs the feather the skin will literally open up and release the feather at will.



* This [[rAskHistorians]] response discusses [what a chantry is](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lm4pdp/what_happened_to_all_the_perpetual_mass/) and why they no longer exist. It never bothered me enough to look it up because I honestly assumed that Dragon Age had just invented them as an alternative to "Catholic Church" but it's kind of cool knowing that they based it on something real. 
* Read this article about [hypothermia](http://dankoboldt.com/hypothermia-in-fiction/) directed at fiction writers, but overall I'm not sure it told me anything I couldn't have found elsewhere on the internet. It might be useful for one of the "truth is stranger than fiction" [[Article & Blog Ideas]], though, since you can get hypothermia at 70F and most readers probably wouldn't buy that. 
* Interesting [[rAskHistorians]] [discussion about the border "marches" in the UK and Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lmio13/what_exactly_was_a_march_they_were_defensive/), which shines some interesting light on the Spellsong Cycle by LE Modessit and might be useful for [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]]. 
* Learned about https://the.rip for unrolling twitter threads into markdown. 


* [This article about mostly-invisible animals](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170622-the-animals-that-are-almost-invisible) is probably useful for worldbuilding. Most translucent animals live in the sea, but not all — there's a species of butterfly and a species of snail that manage it. 
* I enjoyed this [book recommendation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kcece4/askhistorians_2020_holiday_book_recommendation/) from [[rAskHistorians]]. I'm particularly interested in:
	* _The Pillow Book_ by Sei Shōnagon
	* _After the Ice: A Global Human History 20,000-5000 BC_ by Steven Mithen

* This [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/lrmtbm/has_there_been_a_group_of_people_who_have_adapted) had a lot of really interesting information about sleep in different cultures that I should cross reference against a previous daily note about sleep in two African cultures to synthesize a new note that I can use as a basis for [[Culture Creation from the Bed Up]], along the lines of a world building article about the nature of sleep in different cultures as an overlooked way to create a unique culture. 
* This [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13r37l/many_fantasyhistorical_computer_games_and_rpgs) is an absolutely fantastic discussion of how historic palaces led to the mythology surrounding the labyrinth and video game style dungeons. 
* This [article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-unearth-golden-tongued-mummy-egypt-180976905/) is a neat idea for world building, it talks about how in [[Egypt]], mummies had their tongues replaced with golden tongues so that the individual who was buried would have a tongue in the afterlife and be able to talk. It's a similar idea to [[Greek]] paying the ferryman with a coin under the tongue. 

* This [deep dive](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lnbymk/do_historiansarcheologists_think_that_cyrus) into the relationships between Babylon and Assyria in [[Mesopotamia]] around the time of Cyrus and how conquering leaders paid lip service to the religious cultural preferences of the local people in the areas they conquered was a pretty interesting look at how conquerors need to conform to the local preferences in order to effectively rule. This was pretty common in a lot of ancient and even medieval conquests for example the assimilation of native gods into the Catholic Pantheon. This should probably become an atomic note for that concept. #Atomize
* I particularly enjoyed this deep dive into [historical laundry](https://kimrendfeld.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/laundry-in-the-18th-and-early-19th-centuries/), written by a historical fiction author — which just goes to show that I'm not the only one combing academic texts to find useful resources for writing fiction. 
This [roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lsrt2i/who_exactly_were_the_sea_people_and_how_did_they/) is a nice overview of why the whole "sea people are responsible for the Bronze Age Collapse" is basically bullshit. 

- Interesting [history of the invention of the bow](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lt7e1h/how_did_bows_and_arrows_evolve_separately_so_many/) with some useful insights about why it's difficult to determine whether the bow and arrow were invented once (like the [[2020.12.07 Waterwheels|wheel]]) or multiple times (like agriculture) in different times and places. It also covers competing technology like the blow pipe and sling. One problem is that [[2020.08.31 Arrows|arrows]] can be made of bone or wood and don't necessarily remain in the archaeological record. 


* I enjoyed [this long-form book review about a 1980s era book about class in America](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-fussell-on-class?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MDc2ODE1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozMjg2MzQ2NSwiXyI6InpOWllYIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE0MjAxNjI0LCJleHAiOjE2MTQyMDUyMjQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi04OTEyMCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.Bo5OUyUkfpM7e_eObhZiJbvEQn6EGol82mqqM5bCAgs). I'm not sure I learned anything particularly insightful from it, but it was definitely eerie.

*  Read this interesting [[rAskHistorians]] [answer to "how much of the modern russian far east did the chinese explore?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i659jg/how_much_of_the_modern_russian_far_east_did_the/) that details the interactions between Russia and [[China]], particularly [[Mongols]] and Manchuria from the 7th century to the 1800s. This was linked from an [answer about Hokkaido (Japan) and the native Ainu people](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lni0t3/looking_for_reading_suggestions_on_hokkaido/).
I really enjoyed the new T. Kingfisher Paladin book. The tone was great humor and serials.
