## Reflections
*  Read this interesting [[rAskHistorians]] [answer to "how much of the modern russian far east did the chinese explore?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i659jg/how_much_of_the_modern_russian_far_east_did_the/) that details the interactions between Russia and [[China]], particularly [[Mongols]] and Manchuria from the 7th century to the 1800s. This was linked from an [answer about Hokkaido (Japan) and the native Ainu people](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lni0t3/looking_for_reading_suggestions_on_hokkaido/).
## Accomplishments
* Submitted nominations for the Hugo Awards
