## Reflections

* The blogger at Old European culture has a really great [article](http://oldeuropeanculture.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-best-bits.html) about the culinary uses for entrails and organs, the animal slaughtering schedule/calendar in 1900s Serbia, and posits that the eating of entrails and especially chyme, which is basically gastric juices and partially digested food from the entrails of animals. He posits that neolithic humans eating chyme may have been related to the early invention of cheese and may even be related to the origins of lactose tolerance in humans. He discusses this more in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/serbiaireland/status/1360985437972684802). 
* Read a couple more pages of [[The Golden Thread by Kassia St Claire|The Golden Thread]] â€” I started the chapter about Viking sails, and it discusses [Ibn Fadlan](https://travellerantiqueland.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/tall-as-date-palms-arab-meets-viking/) and his interactions with the Vikings and particularly the funerary practice of ritually raping and murdering a chief's concubine (which was referenced by [Taher Safavi](https://twitter.com/bewarethejabb?lang=en) in upcoming book BERSERKER QUEEN). I definitely want to tie that in to the forthcoming article about [[Suttee Sacral kingship and Human Sacrifice]]. 
* Found this article about an [ancient shell horn](https://apnews.com/article/18000-year-old-shell-horn-still-works-58e6d61aa9773d2c672854325d884230) that can still play music, despite being over 18,000 years old. Added to [[Article & Blog Ideas]] for something about ancient instruments, cf. [[The Civilizations of Africa - Chapter 3]], which discusses side-blown horns made out of animal horns.
