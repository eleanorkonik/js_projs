## Reflections
* Really enjoyed this [post](https://sarahgailey.substack.com/p/the-unstable-present) from Arkady Martine about how the [[Incan|Inca]] and Byzantine Empires inspired her fiction. Could be useful for the [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] series.
* Did some reading about [Salish wool dogs](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/salish-woolly-dog), an extinct breed of dog that was bred and sheered for their wool by some indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Planning to use this in [[90 Articles/Seeds/Creature Creation for the Textiles Of]]
* [Whalebone](https://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Baleen) is really interesting from a history of fashion perspective, but it's not really a textile; use for [[Creature Creation for the Clothes]] as a blog post accompaniment to the [[Creature Creation for the Textiles Of]] piece, which would be a proper magazine article. 
* Learned about [wool pigs](https://www.dartagnan.com/mangalica-pig-heritage-pork.html) which are grown more for their lard than their "wool," so it's not clear whether or not their wool can be used for textiles, but it's still worth nothing for [[Creature Creation for the Textiles Of]]. 
* Did some digging into the history of how feathers were used as textiles, for example [this blanket made out of domestic turkey feathers](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/800-year-old-blanket-holds-clues-turkey-farming-american-southwest-180976438/). Domestic turkeys are interesting because you can pluck them painlessly while they're alive and use the feathers for lots of things like blankets. 

> The turkey is the only bird that allows feathers to be taken and it wonâ€™t bleed; It has a defensive mechanism to where if a predator grabs the feather the skin will literally open up and release the feather at will.
