## Reflections

* This [[rAskHistorians]] thread on the topic of [how much did Persia, Rome and China have to do with Axum](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ldwcqz/the_manichean_prophet_mani_regarded_axum_as_one/) might be useful cross-referencing with [[The Civilizations of Africa - Chapter 5#ch05p215 Politics and Trade in the Kingdom of Aksum]]. #FollowUp 

## Accomplishments

* signed up to help Deray analyze and rate [police union contracts](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3890&context=dlj) so that should be interesting.
