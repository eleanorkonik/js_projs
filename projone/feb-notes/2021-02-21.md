## Reflections
* [This article about mostly-invisible animals](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170622-the-animals-that-are-almost-invisible) is probably useful for worldbuilding. Most translucent animals live in the sea, but not all â€” there's a species of butterfly and a species of snail that manage it. 
## Accomplishments
* Wrote 13 critiques. 
* Installed mkdocs using the command line! 
* Got [[2021.02.21 Wool]] written. 
* submitted [[obsidian-export windows documentation]]
