## Reflections
* The [Citibank vs. Revlon case](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/citigroup-loses-fight-to-get-back-millions-in-mistaken-transfer) is pretty interesting (and high in schadenfreude). It boils down to a "no take backsies" kind of argument. Apparently it's an accepted part of the finance world that take-backsies is allowed and legal if the judge decides that all parties involved could reasonably be expected to view it as a mistake at the time the transaction occurred. But this only applies for *obvious* mistakes and the debate is basically over how much you can expect someone who receives money to be like "are you sure? are you SURE you want to do something that totally makes sense?"
* I read and processed a bunch from [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony]]. My big takeaways were:
	* [[labels for different kinds of human settlements]] supertowns aren't the same things as cities. There were some interesting implications for [[Impacts of Increasing Population Density]] that I need to add to that roundup, too. 
	* [[Creature Creation from the Taming Of]] - there was a lot of information about the impacts of domestication, particularly of horses. 
	* [[Contextualizing Ancient Wars for Modern Eyes]] - lots of stuff that reminds me of [[2021-01-03]] and the information there about why the ancients raided.
