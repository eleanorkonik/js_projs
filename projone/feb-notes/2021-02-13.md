## Reflections

* I enjoyed [The Precision of Sensory Evidence](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-precision-of-sensory-evidence) via Scott Alexander at Astral Ten Codex. It presented the first "unified theory of depression" I've ever really come across, and has some really interesting explanations — with citations, from a licensed psychiatrist — of recent research into how depression commonly works, how "priors" can come to outweigh other lived experiences when experiencing depression — and why meditation and yoga and massage (and hugs!) help combat this. 
* This [thread about privacy and sex in different cultures throughout history](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4qkr04/what_was_sex_like_when_most_people_lived_in_1/), which involves a very polite disagreement (aka a bare-knuckle brawl by academic standards) between academics about how the Protestant Reformation impacted European ideals about sex and privacy, the importance of beds (and more importantly, bed *curtains*) as cultural heirlooms, and some interesting legal cases, particularly relating toward the evolution of Italian sexual mores from the Roman era to Florence with regards to sodomy norms at different ages. %% I used this for the [[2021.02.15 Beds]] newsletter %%
