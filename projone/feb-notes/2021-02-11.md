## Reflections

* I enjoyed [this article about synthesis and notetaking](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/2) which outlines these four type of notes for the synthesis process, which I find significantly more insightful than just "take atomic notes" â€” ^451805

> * Question notes, which express an open research question,
> * Synthesis notes, which express a single, generalized idea, such as a claim,
> * Observation notes, which express a single, highly contextualized and specific observation that, together with other observation notes, can form the basis of a synthesis note, and
> * Context snippet notes, which help to ground and contextualize observation notes.

## Accomplishments

* Submitted RECYCLED to [[Inkblood - The Drop]] (Expect feedback by [[2021-03-12]])
