## Reflections
* Read a really interesting [[rAskHistorians]] [piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l8es9o/the_mongols_while_invading_song_dynasty_china/) on [[China]] and why claims that it was "almost" industrialized before the Mongols came along and smashed the Song Dynasty are terrible claims. It goes into detail about the prerequisites for industrialization and how necessity is the mother of invention and what not that would be useful for planning out an Industrial Revolution in Verraine. 
## Accomplishments
* Wrote a new opening scene for [[01 Sewers]]. 
* Implemented a writemonkey [[scratchpad]]
