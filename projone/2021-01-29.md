## Reflections
* This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l7ga78/the_five_element_system_earth_water_fire_air/?user_id=107156619577) via [[rAskHistorians]] does a really nice job of clearing up misconceptions about whether or not the elements of [[classical antiquity]] really grew out of [[Greek]] thought: the tl;dr on this is that Aristotle and Plato are *erroneously* both given credit for the 5 elements theory (earth, air, wind, fire, spirit). 
## Accomplishments
* Figured out how to integrate [[LCC|Library of Congress Classification]] system into my vault for dead tree books. 
* Typed up all of the notes for chapter one of [[13.01b The Civilizations of Africa]].
