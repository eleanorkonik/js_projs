## Reflections
* [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l8zfmc/did_the_99_feel_rome_declining/) in [[rAskHistorians]] really reminded me of the homilies given in L. E. Modesitt's *Imager Portfolio* -- I hadn't realized they were an actual thing that happened in the early Christian church, and now I want to riff off of that for my [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] series. 
## Accomplishments
* Started typing up notes for [[13.04 The Phoenicians and the West]]
