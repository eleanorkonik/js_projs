## Tips

* Alec suggests starting with just node and not messing with election yet. 
* Ryan suggests reverse-engineering an existing plugin. 

## Plugin Ideas

* [[copy backlinks idea]]
* automagically make all the files in a folder appear one after another as though one file in obsidian (e.g. scrivener folder view)
* copy and paste all of the files that return in a search I run on my obsidian vault into a particular folder (e.g. all files related to "Mesopotamia") with option to concatenate or not. 

## Navigation

- When searching for practice programs make sure to look for "console" things to avoid the tutorials trying to get you to make a server.
- to switch from "c" drive to "d" drive just type `D:` into the console (which is helpfully provided by VSCode). 
- to navigate to a folder in the command line, use `cd` i.e. `cd js_projs` will move from `D:` drive to `D:\js_projs\` folder

## Lingering questions: 

Does this work?

`printf("color %s, word %s", "red", "squirrel")`
